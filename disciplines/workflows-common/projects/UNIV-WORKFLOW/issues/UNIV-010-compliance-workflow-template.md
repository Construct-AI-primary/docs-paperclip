# UNIV-010: Regulatory Compliance Workflow Template Creation

## Description

Create universal regulatory compliance workflow template for building codes, safety regulations, and environmental standards across all engineering disciplines.

**Context**: Regulatory compliance is the 2nd highest-value universal workflow. All engineering disciplines must comply with codes and regulations, but the specific codes vary by discipline (building codes, electrical codes, safety regulations, environmental standards).

**Objectives**:
- Design compliance checking workflow structure
- Create code database integration framework
- Build automated compliance verification system
- Establish documentation and reporting standards
- Ensure 85-90% reusability across disciplines

**Scope**:
- In Scope: Workflow template, code integration, verification automation, reporting
- Out of Scope: Discipline-specific code databases (handled in UNIV-011)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Compliance workflow template created with all standard stages
- [ ] Code database integration framework implemented
- [ ] Automated compliance checking logic developed
- [ ] Non-compliance reporting and resolution workflow established
- [ ] Documentation standards defined
- [ ] Template tested with 3 different regulatory frameworks
- [ ] Reusability metric achieves >85% across test cases

- BLOCKS: [UNIV-013] (Deployment depends on template completion)

## Estimated Effort

- **Complexity**: complex
- **Estimated Hours**: 24-30 hours
- **Timeline**: 4-5 days

## Paperclip Task Schema

agent: guardian-qualityforge
toolsets:
  - file_tools
  - code_execution
  - terminal_tools
max_iterations: 90
priority: 2
```

## Technical Notes

**Compliance Workflow Stages**:
1. **Requirements Identification**: Determine applicable codes and regulations
2. **Design Review**: Check design compliance before finalization
3. **Automated Verification**: Run compliance checks against code database
4. **Manual Review**: Expert review of automated findings
5. **Non-Compliance Resolution**: Document and resolve violations
6. **Final Verification**: Confirm all requirements met
7. **Compliance Certification**: Generate compliance reports

**Code Integration Framework**:
```yaml
code_database:
  types:
    - building_codes  # IBC, local codes
    - electrical_codes  # NEC, local electrical codes
    - safety_regulations  # OSHA, industry-specific
    - environmental_standards  # EPA, local environmental
  
  integration:
    - lookup_api  # Query code requirements
    - verification_rules  # Automated checking logic
    - update_mechanism  # Keep codes current
  
  output:
    - compliance_checklist
    - violation_report
    - certification_document
```

**Automated Verification**:
- Rule-based checking for quantifiable requirements
- Checklist generation for manual review items
- Severity classification (critical, major, minor)
- Resolution tracking and verification

## Success Validation

**How to verify completion**:
1. Test with 3 different regulatory frameworks
2. Validate automated verification accuracy (>90%)
3. Review template with compliance experts
4. Measure reusability across different code types

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Comprehensive compliance workflow template
- >85% reusability achieved
- Automated verification operational
- Ready for code database integration
