# UNIV-001: Base Specification Development Template Creation

## Description

Create the foundational specification development template that will serve as the universal framework for all 8 engineering disciplines (Architectural, Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Geotechnical, Mechanical, Process, Structural).

**Context**: Specification development is the #1 highest-value universal workflow identified across all engineering disciplines. This template must be 80-95% reusable with minimal customization per discipline.

**Objectives**:
- Design core specification development workflow structure
- Create reusable template components for all discipline types
- Establish standardized sections and formatting
- Build intelligent routing and approval workflows
- Ensure 80-95% cross-discipline reusability

**Scope**:
- In Scope: Template structure, workflow logic, core sections, routing mechanisms
- Out of Scope: Discipline-specific customizations (handled in UNIV-003), deployment (UNIV-004)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Base specification template created with all standard sections
- [ ] Workflow includes: initiation → drafting → review → approval → publication
- [ ] Template variables identified for discipline customization
- [ ] Intelligent routing logic implemented for multi-stakeholder review
- [ ] Documentation complete with usage guidelines
- [ ] Template tested with sample specifications from 3 disciplines
- [ ] Reusability metric achieves >80% across test cases

## Required Skills

- `template-design` (DevForge AI)
- `workflow-architecture` (DevForge AI)
- `specification-development` (DomainForge AI)
- `technical-writing` (shared)

## Dependencies

- BLOCKED BY: [UNIV-000] (Agent assignments must be validated first)
- BLOCKS: [UNIV-002] (Issue library depends on base template)
- BLOCKS: [UNIV-003] (Discipline mapping requires base template)
- RELATED TO: [UNIV-004] (Pilot deployment will test this template)

## Estimated Effort

- **Complexity**: complex
- **Estimated Hours**: 24-32 hours
- **Timeline**: 4-5 days

## Paperclip Task Schema

```yaml
company: devforge-ai
agent: interface-devforge
toolsets:
  - file_tools
  - code_execution
  - terminal_tools
max_iterations: 100
priority: 1
```

## Technical Notes

**Template Structure Requirements**:
1. **Standard Sections**: Scope, References, Standards, Materials, Execution, Quality, Testing
2. **Variable Placeholders**: {DISCIPLINE}, {PROJECT_CODE}, {SPEC_NUMBER}, {APPROVAL_AUTHORITY}
3. **Workflow States**: draft → internal_review → stakeholder_review → approved → published
4. **Routing Logic**: Automatic assignment based on discipline, project phase, and approval levels

**Reusability Strategy**:
- Core structure 100% reusable
- Discipline-specific content in clearly marked sections
- Variable substitution for customization
- Modular sub-templates for specialized requirements

**Reference Materials**:
- Review cross-discipline analysis: `docs-paperclip/procedures/workflows/cross-discipline-workflow-analysis.md`
- Study existing specifications from multiple disciplines
- Consult MasterFormat standards for section numbering

## Success Validation

**How to verify completion**:
1. Review template with domain experts from 3 disciplines
2. Test template generation with sample data
3. Measure reusability percentage across test cases
4. Validate workflow logic with different routing scenarios

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Comprehensive base template ready for discipline mapping
- >80% reusability confirmed
- Clear usage documentation
- Positive feedback from domain expert review
