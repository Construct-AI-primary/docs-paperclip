## Execution Priority Order

Projects are prioritised into phases based on business value and dependency chains. Phase 1 establishes the testing infrastructure. Phase 2 delivers the core procurement workflow plus electrical engineering and safety. Subsequent phases will be added as prioritised.

### Phase 1: Testing (Foundation — Validate Workflow Infrastructure)

All testing projects must be completed first to validate the OpenClaw desktop automation workflow infrastructure before production coding begins.
