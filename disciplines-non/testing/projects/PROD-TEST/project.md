# PROD-TEST Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Production Testing Execution Project
**Project Code**: PROD-TEST
**Discipline**: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Business Criticality**: Critical - Production readiness validation

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Complete execution of 14 production testing documents
- Systematic testing across 5 execution phases (Foundation, Core Features, Integration, Comprehensive, Polish)
- Coverage of authentication, database, navigation, AI services, documents, procurement, agents, UI, integrations, and advanced features
- Error handling, templates, collaboration, permissions, and HITL testing
- Generation of comprehensive testing reports and production readiness assessment

### Out of Scope
- Development of new testing documents
- Modification of existing testing procedures
- Performance/load testing beyond standard validation
- Security penetration testing
- Third-party integration testing

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Systematic Testing**: Execute all 14 testing documents in proper dependency order
2. **Quality Validation**: Ensure all critical application functionality works correctly
3. **Production Readiness**: Validate application stability before production deployment
4. **Issue Documentation**: Create comprehensive error reports for any failures found

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 14 testing documents executed successfully
- [ ] Foundation testing (Phase 1) passes with 100% critical test success
- [ ] Core functionality (Phases 2-3) achieves >95% test pass rate
- [ ] Comprehensive testing reports generated
- [ ] Production readiness assessment completed

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation Testing (Days 1-2)
- Execute Documents 1-6 (tier1-testing through environment-switching-testing)
- Focus: Authentication, Database, Navigation, Environment Setup
- Duration: ~8 hours

### Phase 2: Core Feature Testing (Days 3-5)
- Execute Documents 7-10 (tier2-testing through discipline-testing)
- Focus: Documents, Procurement, Agents, UI Settings, Discipline Pages
- Duration: ~12 hours

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (Days 6-7)
- Execute Documents 11-12 (tier3-testing and chatbot-testing)
- Focus: Error Handling, Templates, Collaboration, Permissions, Chatbot
- Duration: ~6 hours

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing (Day 8)
- Execute Documents 13 (tier4-testing)
- Focus: Advanced Features and UI/UX Polish
- Duration: ~2 hours

### Phase 5: Polish & Edge Cases (Day 9)
- Execute Document 14 (HITL-testing)
- Focus: Human-in-the-Loop testing and final validation
- Duration: ~2 hours

### Key Milestones
- **Day 2**: Foundation testing complete - proceed to core features
- **Day 5**: Core functionality validated - proceed to integration
- **Day 7**: System integration verified - proceed to comprehensive testing
- **Day 9**: All testing phases complete - production readiness assessment

## Project Team

### Primary Company: QualityForge AI
**Team**: Testing & Validation
**Lead Agent**: validator-qualityforge (Quality Assurance Specialist)

### Supporting Teams
- **DomainForge AI**: Page design knowledge for discipline testing (PROD-010)
- **DevForge AI**: Development support for test environment setup
- **InfraForge AI**: Infrastructure and database support
- **Hermes Agent**: Automated testing execution

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Test Environment Issues**: Production environment not properly configured
- **API Service Failures**: External services (OpenAI, etc.) unavailable during testing
- **Database Connectivity**: Supabase connection or data issues
- **Browser Compatibility**: Testing environment browser issues

### Operational Risks
- **Time Constraints**: 21-hour testing timeline may be ambitious
- **Dependency Blockers**: Critical test failures preventing subsequent testing
- **Resource Availability**: Limited access to required testing tools/accounts
- **Documentation Gaps**: Incomplete or unclear testing procedures

## Budget & Resources

### Estimated Effort: 9 days
### Key Resources Required:
- Quality assurance testing expertise
- Access to production testing environment
- Valid API keys for all external services
- Browser testing tools and DevTools access
- Error reporting and documentation tools

## Success Metrics

### Process Metrics
- **Test Execution Rate**: 14/14 testing documents completed
- **Phase Completion**: All 5 phases executed successfully
- **Issue Discovery**: Comprehensive documentation of all issues found
- **Time Variance**: Actual vs estimated execution time tracking

### Quality Metrics
- **Critical Test Pass Rate**: 100% for foundation testing
- **Overall Test Pass Rate**: >95% for core functionality
- **Issue Resolution**: All critical issues documented and escalated
- **Production Readiness**: Clear go/no-go recommendation

### Business Impact Metrics
- **Deployment Confidence**: High confidence in production stability
- **Risk Mitigation**: All known issues identified and addressed
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive validation of application functionality
- **User Experience**: Validated end-to-end user workflows
