) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  (SELECT id FROM companies WHERE name = 'InfraForge AI'),
  'Nimbus',
  'specialist',
  'Supabase Database Specialist',
  'Supabase API mastery, PostgreSQL expertise, SQL generation/testing',
  (SELECT id FROM agents WHERE name = 'orchestrator-infraforge-ceo'),
  'active',
  '{"team": "infrastructure", "specialization": "Supabase Database Operations"}'::jsonb,
