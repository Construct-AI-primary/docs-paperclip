# MOBILE-004: Execute Mobile Performance Testing

## Description

Execute comprehensive mobile performance testing to validate battery usage, memory consumption, network efficiency, and overall app responsiveness across target devices.

## Required Actions

Execute performance test cases using MobileForge AI optimization tools:
- Battery drain testing (target: <10% per hour)
- Memory usage monitoring (target: <200MB)
- Network performance testing (various conditions)
- App launch time optimization
- CPU usage and thermal performance testing

## Assigned Company & Agent

- **Company:** MobileForge AI
- **Agent:** performance-optimizer-mobileforge (Performance Optimizer)
- **Supporting:**
