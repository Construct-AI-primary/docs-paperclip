3. CAD integration agents (7+ agents for CAD system support)
4. Procurement integration agents (6 agents for procurement workflows)
5. Visual overlay and audit trail agents (4 agents)
6. Swarm communication and coordination protocols

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 35-40 agents successfully deployed and operational
- [ ] Agent swarm coordinator managing workflow orchestration
- [ ] Element detection accuracy >99% across all building types
- [ ] CAD system integration working for all 7 supported platforms
- [ ] Procurement pipeline integration functional
- [ ] Visual audit trails rendering correctly
- [ ] Swarm performance meeting latency targets (<5 seconds)

## Dual-Path Procurement Architecture

### Traditional Formal Path (QS)
```
CAD Drawings → QS Measurement → ASAQS Standards → BOQ Generation → Tender Documentation → Procurement Orders
     ↓              ↓                 ↓                  ↓                    ↓                    ↓
Standards      Quantity Survey    Compliance        Contract             01900 PROC-ORDER      Candy
Validation     Professional       Checking         Tender               Workflows            Integration
```

### New Builder Direct Path
```
CAD Drawings → Builder Measurement → Direct Extraction → Procurement Segregation → Order Generation → Material Delivery → Construction
     ↓               ↓                      ↓                     ↓                     ↓                   ↓                    ↓
MeasureForge    Quantity Extraction    Candy Integration    Subcontract/PO/SO/WO       PROC-ORDER          Site Delivery        Installation
AI Platform     & Cost Estimation      & Budget Control    Classification             Integration         & Quality Control     & Progress
```

### Procurement Segregation Logic
The MeasureForge AI swarm implements intelligent procurement segregation that routes measurements to appropriate procurement categories:

#### Subcontract Classification
- **Electrical subcontracts**: Power distribution, lighting, backup systems
- **Plumbing subcontracts**: Water supply, drainage, fire suppression
- **HVAC subcontracts**: Ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration
- **Fire protection subcontracts**: Sprinklers, alarms, suppression
- **Structural steel subcontracts**: Fabrication, erection, connections

#### Purchase Order Generation
- **Structural materials**: Concrete, steel, masonry
- **Architectural finishes**: Flooring, ceiling, partition systems
- **MEP equipment**: Transformers, pumps, air handling units
- **Civil materials**: Aggregate, asphalt, piping
- **Specialty products**: Acoustic panels, special glazing

#### Service Order Generation
- **Testing services**: Concrete, soil, electrical, structural
- **Inspection services**: Building, fire, electrical, plumbing
- **Commissioning services**: MEP systems, building envelope
- **Maintenance services**: HVAC, electrical, plumbing
- **Consulting services**: Engineering, architecture, project management

#### Work Order Generation
- **Site preparation**: Demolition, excavation, grading
- **Concrete works**: Foundations, slabs, structures
- **Structural steel**: Erection, connection, fireproofing
- **Architectural finishes**: Painting, flooring, ceilings
- **General labor**: Site cleanup, material handling, helpers

## Department Handoff Integration

### Contracts Department Handoff

The MeasureForge AI swarm implements automated handoff to contracts and procurement departments through PROC-ORDER workflow integration:

#### Handoff Triggers
- **Measurement Completion**: Automatic notification when measurement accuracy reaches 99.5%
- **Procurement Segregation**: Real-time routing based on procurement category classification
- **Budget Validation**: Automatic checks against allocated budgets before handoff
- **Compliance Verification**: Standards compliance validation before department transfer

#### Contracts Department Integration
```javascript
// Automated handoff to contracts department
const departmentHandoff = {
  contractsDepartment: {
    triggerEvents: [
      'measurement_accuracy_achieved',
      'procurement_category_determined',
      'budget_allocation_confirmed'
    ],
    handoffData: {
      projectId: 'PROJ-2026-001',
      measurementData: 'complete_measurement_package',
      procurementCategories: ['subcontract', 'purchase_order', 'service_order'],
      budgetAllocation: 'allocated_amounts',
      complianceStatus: 'standards_verified',
      timelineRequirements: 'contract_deadlines'
    },
    notificationChannels: [
      'PROC-ORDER_system_integration',
      'email_notifications',
      'dashboard_alerts',
      'mobile_push_notifications'
    ]
  }
};
```

#### Procurement Department Integration
```javascript
// Procurement department workflow handoff
const procurementHandoff = {
  procurementDepartment: {
    workflowIntegration: 'PROC-ORDER_v2.1',
    dataMapping: {
      measurementQuantities: 'procurement_quantities',
      materialSpecifications: 'procurement_specs',
      supplierRequirements: 'approved_suppliers',
      deliverySchedules: 'procurement_timeline'
    },
    approvalWorkflows: {
      valueBased: 'amount > R500k requires director approval',
      categoryBased: 'subcontracts require technical review',
      timelineBased: 'critical path items fast-tracked'
    },
    escalationProtocols: {
      budgetExceeded: 'immediate notification to project director',
      timelineDelay: 'escalation to procurement manager',
      supplierUnavailable: 'alternative supplier sourcing'
    }
  }
};
```

### Department Communication Protocols

|--------|--------|-------------|
| Handoff Time | <5 minutes | From measurement completion to department notification |
| Data Accuracy | 100% | All transferred data matches source measurements |
| Error Rate | <0.1% | Data transfer errors or missing information |
