## Prerequisites

### Required Access
- PostgreSQL admin access to Supabase database
- `psql` command-line tool installed
- Database credentials (connection string)

### Required Knowledge
- Understanding of SQL and foreign key constraints
- Familiarity with PostgreSQL transactions
- Basic understanding of Paperclip data model

### Backup Requirements
**CRITICAL**: Always create a backup before deletion operations:

```bash
# Create database backup
PGPASSWORD='your_password' pg_dump -h db.host.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres \
  -f backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

### Scripts Location
Pre-built cleanup scripts are available:
- Companies: `scripts/database/cleanup_archived_companies.sql`
- Agents: `scripts/database/cleanup_terminated_agents.sql`

---

## Important Considerations

### Before You Delete

1. **Soft Delete vs Hard Delete**
   - Consider using `status='archived'` or `deleted_at` timestamps first
   - Hard deletion is permanent and cannot be easily reversed

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Run analysis queries to understand deletion impact
   - Review dependencies and affected records
   - Communicate with stakeholders about affected issues/projects

3. **Timing**
   - Schedule deletions during low-activity periods
   - Ensure no active agent operations are running
   - Allow sufficient time for verification

4. **Data Preservation**
   - Export critical data before deletion
   - Document deleted entities for audit trail
   - Consider archiving historical data separately

---

## Foreign Key Dependency Overview

Understanding the FK dependency chain is crucial for proper deletion order.

### Company Deletion Dependencies (92 FK relationships)

Companies are referenced by 40+ tables. The deletion order must be:

## Procedure A: Deleting Archived Companies

### Step 1: Identify Companies to Delete

```sql
-- List archived companies
SELECT id, name, status, created_at, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agents WHERE company_id = companies.id) as agent_count,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM goals WHERE company_id = companies.id) as goal_count,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issues WHERE company_id = companies.id) as issue_count
FROM companies 
WHERE status = 'archived'
ORDER BY name;
```

**Review the output carefully**:
- Note company names and IDs
- Check agent counts (will be deleted)
- Check goal and issue counts (will be deleted)
- Verify these are truly obsolete companies

### Step 2: Document Deletion Scope

Create a record of what will be deleted:

```sql
-- Export deletion impact report
COPY (
  SELECT 'Company' as type, c.name, c.id::text
  FROM companies c
  WHERE c.status = 'archived'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Agent', a.name, a.id::text
  FROM agents a
  WHERE a.company_id IN (SELECT id FROM companies WHERE status = 'archived')
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Goal', g.title, g.id::text
  FROM goals g
  WHERE g.company_id IN (SELECT id FROM companies WHERE status = 'archived')
) TO '/tmp/deletion_manifest.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
```

### Step 3: Create Database Backup

```bash
# Create timestamped backup
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
PGPASSWORD='your_password' pg_dump -h db.host.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres \
  -f backup_before_company_deletion_${TIMESTAMP}.sql

# Verify backup exists and has content
ls -lh backup_before_company_deletion_${TIMESTAMP}.sql
```

### Step 4: Execute Deletion Script

```bash
# Run the cleanup script
PGPASSWORD='your_password' psql -h db.host.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres \
  -f scripts/database/cleanup_archived_companies.sql
```

**The script will**:
1. Display companies to be deleted
2. Delete all dependencies in correct order
3. Delete the companies
4. Show remaining companies
5. Commit the transaction

### Step 5: Verify Deletion

```sql
-- Confirm no archived companies remain
SELECT COUNT(*) as archived_count FROM companies WHERE status = 'archived';
-- Expected: 0

-- Confirm active companies intact
SELECT name, status FROM companies WHERE status = 'active' ORDER BY name;

-- Verify no orphaned records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agents WHERE company_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM companies);
-- Expected: 0

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM goals WHERE company_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM companies);
-- Expected: 0
```

### Step 6: Document Results

Create a cleanup report documenting:
- Companies deleted (names, IDs, deletion timestamp)
- Record counts deleted
- Remaining companies
- Any issues encountered

Template: `docs-paperclip/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-archived-companies-cleanup.md`

---

## Procedure B: Deleting Terminated Agents

### Step 1: Identify Agents to Delete

```sql
-- List terminated and soft-deleted agents
SELECT a.id, c.name as company, a.name as agent_name, 
       a.status, a.is_active, a.deleted_at, a.created_at,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issues WHERE assignee_agent_id = a.id) as assigned_issues,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issues WHERE created_by_agent_id = a.id) as created_issues
FROM agents a
JOIN companies c ON a.company_id = c.id
WHERE a.status = 'terminated' OR a.deleted_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY c.name, a.name;
```

**Review the output carefully**:
- Note agent names and IDs
- Check company assignments
- Review issue counts (will be unassigned)
- Verify these agents are truly obsolete

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT delete agents with status='idle' unless they have `deleted_at` set. "Idle" is the normal ready state for agents.

### Step 2: Assess Impact

```sql
-- Check what will be affected
SELECT 
  'Agents' as entity,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM agents
WHERE status = 'terminated' OR deleted_at IS NOT NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'Issues to unassign (assignee)',
  COUNT(*)
FROM issues
WHERE assignee_agent_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM agents WHERE status = 'terminated' OR deleted_at IS NOT NULL
)

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'Issues to unassign (creator)',
  COUNT(*)
FROM issues
WHERE created_by_agent_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM agents WHERE status = 'terminated' OR deleted_at IS NOT NULL
)

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'Agent hierarchy refs',
  COUNT(*)
FROM agents
WHERE reports_to IN (
  SELECT id FROM agents WHERE status = 'terminated' OR deleted_at IS NOT NULL
);
```

### Step 3: Create Database Backup

```bash
# Create timestamped backup
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
PGPASSWORD='your_password' pg_dump -h db.host.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres \
  -f backup_before_agent_deletion_${TIMESTAMP}.sql

# Verify backup exists
ls -lh backup_before_agent_deletion_${TIMESTAMP}.sql
```

### Step 4: Execute Deletion Script

```bash
# Run the cleanup script
PGPASSWORD='your_password' psql -h db.host.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres \
  -f scripts/database/cleanup_terminated_agents.sql
```

**The script will**:
1. Display agents to be deleted
2. Delete all dependencies in correct order
3. Update nullable FK references to NULL
4. Delete the agents
5. Show remaining agent distribution
6. Commit the transaction

### Step 5: Verify Deletion

```sql
-- Confirm no terminated agents remain
SELECT COUNT(*) as terminated_count 
FROM agents 
WHERE status = 'terminated' OR deleted_at IS NOT NULL;
-- Expected: 0

-- Verify agent status distribution
SELECT status, is_active, COUNT(*) as count
FROM agents
GROUP BY status, is_active
ORDER BY status, is_active;

-- Check for orphaned references (should be 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agent_api_keys 
WHERE agent_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM agents);
-- Expected: 0
```

### Step 6: Review Affected Issues

```sql
-- List issues that lost their assignee
SELECT id, title, status, company_id
FROM issues
WHERE assignee_agent_id IS NULL
  AND status NOT IN ('done', 'closed')
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Post-deletion action**: These issues may need manual reassignment to active agents.

### Step 7: Document Results

Create a cleanup report documenting:
- Agents deleted (names, companies, deletion timestamp)
- Record counts deleted/updated
- Issues requiring reassignment
- Any issues encountered

Template: `docs-paperclip/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-terminated-agents-cleanup.md`

---

## Verification Steps

### General Health Checks

Run these queries after any deletion operation:

```sql
-- 1. FK integrity check (should return no rows)
SELECT 'orphaned_agents' as check_name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM agents WHERE company_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM companies)
UNION ALL
SELECT 'orphaned_goals', COUNT(*)
FROM goals WHERE company_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM companies)
UNION ALL
SELECT 'orphaned_agent_api_keys', COUNT(*)
FROM agent_api_keys WHERE agent_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM agents)
UNION ALL
SELECT 'orphaned_heartbeat_runs', COUNT(*)
FROM heartbeat_runs WHERE agent_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM agents);

-- 2. Company health check
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as company_count,
  SUM((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agents WHERE company_id = companies.id)) as total_agents
FROM companies
GROUP BY status;

-- 3. Agent health check
SELECT 
  c.name as company,
  COUNT(a.id) as agent_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN a.status = 'idle' THEN 1 END) as idle,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN a.status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN a.status = 'error' THEN 1 END) as error
FROM companies c
LEFT JOIN agents a ON c.id = a.company_id AND a.is_active = true
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY c.name;
```

All orphan checks should return count = 0.

## Rollback Procedures

### If Deletion Fails Mid-Transaction

PostgreSQL transactions will auto-rollback on error. The database will be unchanged.

### If Deletion Completes But Needs Reversal

**Option 1**: Restore from backup (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Stop application access to database first
# Then restore from backup
PGPASSWORD='your_password' psql -h db.host.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres \
  < backup_before_deletion_TIMESTAMP.sql
```

**Option 2**: Selective restoration

If you only need to restore specific companies/agents:

```bash
# Extract specific tables from backup
PGPASSWORD='your_password' pg_restore -h db.host.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres \
  -t companies -t agents backup_file.dump
```

**Important**: Full restoration may conflict with any data created after the backup. Always test in a staging environment first.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Foreign Key Violation

**Symptom**: `ERROR: update or delete on table "X" violates foreign key constraint "Y"`

**Cause**: Deletion order is incorrect or script missed a dependency

**Solution**:
1. The transaction will auto-rollback, database is safe
2. Identify the missing table in the error message
3. Add deletion for that table before the table it references
4. Re-run the script

**Example**:
```
ERROR: delete on table "heartbeat_runs" violates FK "activity_log_run_id_fk"
```
Means: Delete from `activity_log` BEFORE deleting from `heartbeat_runs`

### Error: Temp Table Already Exists

**Symptom**: `ERROR: relation "agents_to_delete" already exists`

**Cause**: Previous script run didn't complete cleanup

**Solution**:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS agents_to_delete;
-- Then re-run script
```

### Slow Deletion Performance

**Symptom**: Script takes very long to execute

**Cause**: Large number of records, missing indexes, or lock contention

**Solutions**:
1. Run during low-activity periods
2. Consider batching deletions (delete 1 company at a time)
3. Check for locks: `SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted;`
4. Ensure indexes exist on FK columns

### Deletion Completes But Data Seems Inconsistent

**Actions**:
1. Run verification queries immediately
2. Check for orphaned records
3. Review transaction log
4. If serious inconsistency found, restore from backup
5. Document issue for investigation
